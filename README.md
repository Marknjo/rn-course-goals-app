# A Student's Course Goals App Built with React Native

This is a simple React Native app built with React Native. The goal is to explore basics of React Native by building something simple. I am building on Windows, so most of the test I will do will be on Android. However, the app is fully tested on IOS, using Expo snacks/IOS simulator.

## Requirements

You only need VsCode, NodeJs and install the dependencies.

_Incase anything just reach out ðŸ˜œ._
